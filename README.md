# Breaking-down-modality-barriers-Semantic-cue-guided-Raman-spectroscopy-for-mineral-identification

# Overview
This project introduces a Semantic-Clue Reconfiguration (SCR) framework designed for cross-modal modeling between Raman spectroscopy data and mineral structural texts. The proposed multimodal architecture integrates four core components:

1.**Spectral Encoder**: Extracts discriminative features from the Raman spectral data.

2.**Text Encoder**: Utilizes a BERT-based model to generate semantic embeddings from textual descriptions of mineral structures.

3.**Dual Cross-Attention Module**: Enables deep interaction between the spectral and textual modalities by leveraging semantic clues to guide attention, enhancing cross-modal alignment.

4.**Fusion-based Classification Module**: Combines attended features to perform accurate mineral identification.
