# Breaking-down-modality-barriers-Semantic-cue-guided-Raman-spectroscopy-for-mineral-identification

# Overview
This project introduces a Semantic-Clue Reconfiguration (SCR) framework designed for cross-modal modeling between Raman spectroscopy data and mineral structural texts. The proposed multimodal architecture integrates four core components:

Spectral Encoder: Extracts discriminative features from the Raman spectral data.

Text Encoder: Utilizes a BERT-based model to generate semantic embeddings from textual descriptions of mineral structures.

Dual Cross-Attention Module: Enables deep interaction between the spectral and textual modalities by leveraging semantic clues to guide attention, enhancing cross-modal alignment.

Fusion-based Classification Module: Combines attended features to perform accurate mineral identification.
